# SWR_detection_using_concurrent_MEG_iEEG
This is the code used for my project with the title: Can hippocampal sharp wave ripples (SWRs) be recorded with non-invasive magnetoencephalography (MEG)? The code was used to analyse concurrent iEEG and MEG recordings, by detecting SWRs, performing MEG source reconstruction and employing various statistical analyses.
